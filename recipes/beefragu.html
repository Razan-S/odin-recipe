    <h3>The way to make the dish</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high.</li> 
        <li>Season chuck roast with pepper and 2 teaspoons salt.</li> 
        <li>Sear meat until browned on every sides</li>
        <li>Remove from Dutch oven and transfer to a large plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Cook, until softened</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook</li>
        <li>Pour in wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until reduced by two thirds</li>
        <li>Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, chuck roast, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, sauce has thickened, and flavors meld, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a cutting board and shred using 2 forks. Return meat to pot and stir in pappardelle. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
